# Kotlin Discord Bot

This is a Discord bot written in Kotlin. It uses the JDA library to interact with the Discord API.

## Usage

To use this bot, you need to create a new Discord bot application and add it to your server. Then, you need to generate a bot token and add it to the `TOKEN` variable in `bot.kt`.

Once you have done that, you can run this bot using the `main` function.

## Commands

This bot currently responds to one command:

- `!hello` - responses with "Hello, world!"
